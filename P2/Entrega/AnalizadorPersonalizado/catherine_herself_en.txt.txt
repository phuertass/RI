 | SHE | 
 | bade | 
 | HIM | 
 | good | 
 | night | 
 | AND | 
 | went | 
 | upstairs | 
 | TO | 
 | BED | 
 | IN |

 | little | 
 | back | 
 | bedroom | 
 | SHE | 
 | SAT | 
 | down | 
 | ON | 
 | THE | 
 | BED | 
 | AND | 
 | tried | 
 | TO | 
 | gather | 
 | HER | 
 | wits | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | demlehwrevo | 
 | BY | 
 | A | 
 | feeling | 
 | OF | 
 | physical | 
 | weariness | 
 | that | 
 | WAS | 
 | NOT | 
 | surprising | 
 | FOR | 
 | SHE | 
 | HAD | 
 | walked | 
 | perhaps | 
 | fifteen | 
 | miles | 
 | that | 
 | DAY | 
 | IN | 
 | THE | 
 | candle | 
 | light | 
 | SHE | 
 | SAW | 
 | HER | 
 | face | 
 | IN | 
 | THE | 
 | mirror | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | surprised | 
 | TO | 
 | find | 
 | herself | 
 | almost | 
 | ashen | 
 | pale | 
 | HER | 
 | RED | 
 | hair | 
 | floated | 
 | cloud | 
 | like | 
 | around | 
 | HER | 
 | head | 
 | IN | 
 | THE | 
 | little | 
 | hand | 
 | mirror | 
 | there | 
 | WAS | 
 | NOT | 
 | room | 
 | TO | 
 | SEE | 
 | ALL | 
 | OF | 
 | IT | 
 | AT | 
 | once | 
 | BUT | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | still | 
 | flying | 
 | AS | 
 | IF | 
 | IN | 
 | THE | 
 | wind | 
 | AND | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | gorgeously | 
 | wild | 
 | AND | 
 | untamed | 
 | MY | 
 | GOD | 
 | george | 
 | trant | 
 | HAD | 
 | said | 
 | your | 
 | hair | 
 | catherine | 
 | WAS | 
 | surprised | 
 | almost | 
 | shocked | 
 | that | 
 | SHE | 
 | HAD | 
 | AS | 
 | YET | 
 | shed | 
 | NO | 
 | tears | 
 | FOR | 
 | HER | 
 | mother | 
 | IT | 
 | seemed | 
 | such | 
 | A | 
 | brutally | 
 | callous | 
 | piece | 
 | OF | 
 | negligence | 
 | AND | 
 | catherine | 
 | WAS | 
 | sure | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | neither | 
 | brutal | 
 | NOR | 
 | callous | 
 | YET | 
 | tears | 
 | would | 
 | NOT | 
 | come | 
 | SHE | 
 | undressed | 
 | AND | 
 | GOT | 
 | into | 
 | BED | 
 | THE | 
 | pumping |

 | AT | 
 | THE | 
 | water | 
 | works | 
 | went | 
 | ON | 
 | AT | 
 | ITS | 
 | patient | 
 | chug | 
 | chugging | 
 | AND | 
 | forthwith | 
 | A | 
 | myriad | 
 | memories | 
 | OF | 
 | childhood | 
 | came | 
 | back | 
 | TO | 
 | HER | 
 | SHE | 
 | could | 
 | feel | 
 | THE | 
 | tears | 
 | welling | 
 | UP | 
 | into | 
 | HER | 
 | eyes | 
 | AND | 
 | then | 
 | SHE | 
 | realized | 
 | that | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | sentiment | 
 | AND | 
 | NOT | 
 | grief | 
 | that | 
 | WAS | 
 | affecting | 
 | HER | 
 | SHE | 
 | would | 
 | NOT | 
 | weep | 
 | FOR | 
 | sentiment | 
 | like | 
 | THE | 
 | heroines | 
 | IN | 
 | THE | 
 | SIX | 
 | penny | 
 | novels | 
 | that | 
 | madge | 
 | saunders | 
 | read | 
 | ever | 
 | AND |

 | THE | 
 | whisper | 
 | came | 
 | echoing | 
 | through | 
 | HER | 
 | mind | 
 | MY | 
 | GOD | 
 | your | 
 | hair | 
 | from | 
 | THE | 
 | very | 
 | insistence | 
 | OF | 
 | HER | 
 | thoughts | 
 | SHE | 
 | could | 
 | NOT | 
 | fall | 
 | asleep | 
 | until | 
 | morning | 
 | WAS | 
 | well | 
 | advanced | 
 | BUT | 
 | when | 
 | SHE | 
 | DID | 
 | HER | 
 | sleep | 
 | WAS | 
 | calm | 
 | AND | 
 | dreamless | 
 | OF | 
 | course | 
 | there | 
 | WAS | 
 | A | 
 | splendid | 
 | funeral | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | infinitely | 
 | more |

 | taken | 
 | place | 
 | IN |

 | P.S | 
 | MY |

 | there | 
 | would | 
 | BE | 
 | little | 
 | point | 
 | IN | 
 | enclosing | 
 | MY | 
 | address | 
 | catherine | 
 | WAS | 
 | slow | 
 | TO | 
 | grasp | 
 | THE | 
 | full | 
 | meaning | 
 | OF | 
 | THE | 
 | note | 
 | AS | 
 | IT | 
 | dawned | 
 | upon | 
 | HER | 
 | HER | 
 | lips | 
 | tightened | 
 | AND | 
 | SHE | 
 | gripped | 
 | fiercely | 
 | THE | 
 | rail | 
 | against | 
 | which | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | leaning | 
 | THE | 
 | tram | 
 | lurched | 
 | TO | 
 | A | 
 | standstill | 
 | AND | 
 | there | 
 | WAS | 
 | THE | 
 | usual | 
 | scramble | 
 | TO | 
 | GET | 
 | down | 
 | THE | 
 | stairs | 
 | high | 
 | wood | 
 | THE | 
 | conductor | 
 | called | 
 | OUT | 
 | come | 
 | ON | 
 | said | 
 | helen | 
 | AND | 
 | they | 
 | descended | 
 | IN | 
 | THE | 
 | forest | 
 | glades | 
 | THE | 
 | night | 
 | AIR | 
 | WAS | 
 | cool | 
 | AND | 
 | sweet | 
 | FOR | 
 | some | 
 | distance | 
 | they | 
 | walked | 
 | ON | 
 | IN | 
 | silence | 
 | catherine | 
 | WAS | 
 | THE | 
 | first | 
 | TO | 
 | speak | 
 | they | 
 | HAD | 
 | reached | 
 | A | 
 | clearing | 
 | AND | 
 | under | 
 | THE | 
 | open | 
 | SKY | 
 | THE | 
 | daylight | 
 | still | 
 | lingered | 
 | I | 
 | daresay | 
 | you’d | 
 | like | 
 | TO | 
 | read | 
 | IT | 
 | said | 
 | catherine | 
 | SHE | 
 | held | 
 | OUT | 
 | THE | 
 | note | 
 | AT | 
 | arm’s | 
 | length | 
 | helen | 
 | gave | 
 | A | 
 | queer | 
 | yrotalucaje | 
 | laugh | 
 | i’ve | 
 | already | 
 | done | 
 | SO | 
 | SHE | 
 | said | 
 | what | 
 | OH | 
 | I | 
 | know | 
 | it’s | 
 | NOT | 
 | quite | 
 | THE | 
 | thing | 
 | TO | 
 | read | 
 | other | 
 | people’s | 
 | letters | 
 | BUT | 
 | I | 
 | wanted | 
 | TO | 
 | know | 
 | what | 
 | what | 
 | HE | 
 | would | 
 | SAY | 
 | TO | 
 | YOU | 
 | AND | 
 | I | 
 | thought | 
 | perhaps | 
 | YOU | 
 | wouldn’t | 
 | show | 
 | ME | 
 | catherine | 
 | crumpled | 
 | UP | 
 | THE | 
 | note | 
 | AND | 
 | PUT | 
 | IT | 
 | IN | 
 | HER | 
 | pocket | 
 | well | 
 | YOU | 
 | know | 
 | anyway | 
 | SHE | 
 | said | 
 | gloomily | 
 | they | 
 | passed | 
 | again | 
 | into | 
 | THE | 
 | cool | 
 | forest | 
 | glades | 
 | I | 
 | WAS | 
 | right | 
 | said | 
 | helen | 
 | quietly | 
 | I | 
 | knew | 
 | he’d | 
 | write | 
 | YOU | 
 | something | 
 | like | 
 | that | 
 | he’s | 
 | good | 
 | AT | 
 | that | 
 | kind | 
 | OF | 
 | letter | 
 | writing | 
 | sort | 
 | OF | 
 | cheap | 
 | cleverness | 
 | HE | 
 | excels | 
 | AT | 
 | I’D | 
 | half | 
 | A | 
 | mind | 
 | NOT | 
 | TO | 
 | LET | 
 | YOU | 
 | SEE | 
 | IT | 
 | there | 
 | came | 
 | A | 
 | long | 
 | pause | 
 | they | 
 | HAD | 
 | reached | 
 | THE | 
 | high | 
 | road | 
 | TO | 
 | chingford | 
 | before | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | broken | 
 | catherine | 
 | suddenly | 
 | took | 
 | THE | 
 | crumpled | 
 | letter | 
 | from | 
 | HER | 
 | pocket | 
 | AND | 
 | began | 
 | tearing | 
 | IT | 
 | UP | 
 | into | 
 | minute | 
 | fragments | 
 | SEE | 
 | SHE | 
 | cried | 
 | yletanoissap | 
 | YOU | 
 | CAN | 
 | tell | 
 | HIM | 
 | this | 
 | IS | 
 | what | 
 | I | 
 | DID | 
 | with | 
 | HIS | 
 | letter | 
 | I | 
 | YOU | 
 | CAN | 
 | tell | 
 | HIM | 
 | there’s | 
 | better | 
 | fellows | 
 | IN | 
 | THE | 
 | world | 
 | than | 
 | HE | 
 | IS | 
 | AND | 
 | cathie | 
 | weston | 
 | isn’t | 
 | going | 
 | TO | 
 | break | 
 | HER | 
 | heart | 
 | over | 
 | _him_ | 
 | tell | 
 | HIM | 
 | I’M | 
 | NOT | 
 | A | 
 | soppy | 
 | little | 
 | schoolgirl | 
 | SHE | 
 | flung | 
 | THE | 
 | pieces | 
 | ON | 
 | THE | 
 | ground | 
 | AND | 
 | began | 
 | stamping | 
 | ON | 
 | them | 
 | you’re | 
 | being | 
 | silly | 
 | said | 
 | helen | 
 | quietly | 
 | AND | 
 | tell | 
 | HIM | 
 | went | 
 | ON | 
 | catherine | 
 | that | 
 | IF | 
 | HE | 
 | thinks | 
 | he’s | 
 | under | 
 | AN | 
 | obligation | 
 | TO | 
 | ME | 
 | he’s | 
 | made | 
 | A | 
 | mistake | 
 | I’M | 
 | grateful | 
 | TO | 
 | HIM | 
 | FOR | 
 | letting | 
 | ME | 
 | SEE | 
 | what | 
 | HE | 
 | really | 
 | IS | 
 | HER | 
 | words | 
 | rattled | 
 | like | 
 | THE | 
 | passage | 
 | OF | 
 | A | 
 | lorry | 
 | over | 
 | granite | 
 | setts | 
 | come | 
 | ON | 
 | said | 
 | helen | 
 | we’ll | 
 | GET | 
 | TO | 
 | chingford | 
 | AND | 
 | take | 
 | THE | 
 | train | 
 | back | 
 | you’ll | 
 | tell | 
 | HIM | 
 | I | 
 | don’t | 
 | promise | 
 | I | 
 | think | 
 | you’d | 
 | better | 
 | forget | 
 | ALL | 
 | about | 
 | HIM | 
 | after | 
 | ALL | 
 | YOU | 
 | can’t | 
 | DO | 
 | anything | 
 | I | 
 | don’t | 
 | want | 
 | TO | 
 | I | 
 | merely | 
 | want | 
 | HIM | 
 | TO | 
 | know | 
 | that | 
 | I | 
 | don’t | 
 | mind | 
 | well | 
 | that’s | 
 | ALL | 
 | right | 
 | then | 
 | he’ll | 
 | know | 
 | that | 
 | IF | 
 | HE | 
 | hears | 
 | nothing | 
 | from | 
 | YOU | 
 | HE | 
 | won’t | 
 | he’ll | 
 | think | 
 | he’s | 
 | left | 
 | A | 
 | broken | 
 | hearted | 
 | girl | 
 | TO | 
 | CRY | 
 | over | 
 | HIM | 
 | I | 
 | don’t | 
 | think | 
 | HE | 
 | will | 
 | because | 
 | I | 
 | don’t | 
 | believe | 
 | IN | 
 | being | 
 | broken | 
 | hearted | 
 | I | 
 | don’t | 
 | think | 
 | it’s | 
 | possible | 
 | TO | 
 | DIE | 
 | OF | 
 | A | 
 | broken | 
 | heart | 
 | I’M | 
 | certain | 
 | I | 
 | shan’t | 
 | anyway | 
 | I | 
 | won’t | 
 | LET | 
 | ANY | 
 | MAN | 
 | mess | 
 | about | 
 | with | 
 | _my_ | 
 | life | 
 | it’ll | 
 | take | 
 | A | 
 | pretty | 
 | BIG | 
 | misfortune | 
 | TO | 
 | make | 
 | life | 
 | NOT | 
 | worth | 
 | living | 
 | TO | 
 | ME | 
 | IF | 
 | he’s | 
 | tired | 
 | OF | 
 | ME | 
 | I’M | 
 | just | 
 | AS | 
 | tired | 
 | OF | 
 | HIM | 
 | tell | 
 | HIM | 
 | that | 
 | this | 
 | WAY | 
 | said | 
 | helen | 
 | guiding | 
 | HER | 
 | into | 
 | THE | 
 | station |

 | we’ll | 
 | just | 
 | BE |

 | TO | 
 | catch | 
 | THE | 
 | helen | 
 | left | 
 | THE | 
 | train | 
 | AT | 
 | upton | 
 | rising | 
 | BUT | 
 | catherine | 
 | went | 
 | ON | 
 | TO | 
 | bockley | 
 | THE | 
 | town | 
 | hall | 
 | struck | 
 | THE | 
 | hour | 
 | OF | 
 | TEN | 
 | AS | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | walking | 
 | UP | 
 | THE | 
 | station | 
 | approach | 
 | AT | 
 | this | 
 | time | 
 | THE | 
 | crowds | 
 | along | 
 | THE | 
 | high | 
 | street | 
 | were | 
 | beginning | 
 | TO | 
 | disperse | 
 | THE | 
 | trams | 
 | AND |

 | were | 
 | full | 
 | OF | 
 | returning | 
 | stsinoisrucxe | 
 | neglectful |

 | time | 
 | AND | 
 | with | 
 | NO |

 | definite | 
 | AIM | 
 | IN | 
 | view | 
 | catherine | 
 | turned | 
 | into | 
 | THE | 
 | ridgeway | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | directly | 
 | opposite | 
 | TO | 
 | THE | 
 | quickest | 
 | WAY | 
 | home | 
 | BUT | 
 | ITS | 
 | shady | 
 | avenues | 
 | AND | 
 | flower | 
 | scented | 
 | front | 
 | gardens | 
 | suited | 
 | HER | 
 | mood | 
 | better | 
 | than | 
 | THE | 
 | stark | 
 | frowsiness | 
 | OF | 
 | hanson | 
 | street | 
 | HER | 
 | mind | 
 | WAS | 
 | IN |

 | SHE | 
 | DID | 
 | NOT |

 | WAS |

 | HOW | 
 | much | 
 | WAS | 
 | mere |

 | dignity | 
 | SHE | 
 | could | 
 | NOT |

 | THE | 
 | depth | 
 | OF | 
 | THE | 
 | feeling | 
 | SHE | 
 | HAD | 
 | HAD | 
 | FOR | 
 | george |

 | IT |

 | TO | 
 | herself | 
 | wholesome | 
 | sevitcerroc | 
 | it’s | 
 | NO |

 | SHE | 
 | told | 
 | herself | 
 | brutally | 
 | your | 
 | imagining | 
 | yourself | 
 | THE | 
 | heroine | 
 | OF | 
 | A | 
 | tragedy | 
 | suffering | 
 | more | 
 | poignantly | 
 | than | 
 | ninety | 
 | nine | 
 | people | 
 | OUT |

 | it’s |

 | ON | 
 | suffering | 
 | more | 
 | yletisiuqxe | 
 | than | 
 | other | 
 | people | 
 | then | 
 | SHE | 
 | poured | 
 | cold | 
 | logic | 
 | over | 
 | herself | 
 | he’s | 
 | only | 
 | ONE | 
 | MAN | 
 | among | 
 | millions | 
 | AND | 
 | IN | 
 | NO | 
 | sense | 
 | IS | 
 | HE | 
 | markedly | 
 | superior | 
 | TO | 
 | THE | 
 | average | 
 | A | 
 | certain | 
 | spurious | 
 | cleverness | 
 | A | 
 | talent | 
 | FOR | 
 | mockery | 
 | A | 
 | deft | 
 | finesse | 
 | IN | 
 | expressing | 
 | cruel | 
 | things | 
 | IN | 
 | soft | 
 | words | 
 | absurd | 
 | that | 
 | HE | 
 | should | 
 | become | 
 | SO | 
 | much | 
 | TO | 
 | YOU | 
 | OR | 
 | TO | 
 | ANY | 
 | girl | 
 | there’s | 
 | nothing | 
 | admirable | 
 | IN | 
 | HIM | 
 | therefore | 
 | YOU | 
 | ARE | 
 | lucky | 
 | TO | 
 | GET | 
 | RID | 
 | OF | 
 | HIM | 
 | IT | 
 | sounded | 
 | convincing | 
 | enough | 
 | SHE | 
 | walked | 
 | ON | 
 | scarce | 
 | heeding | 
 | whither | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | going | 
 | AND | 
 | ALL | 
 | THE | 
 | time | 
 | HER | 
 | mood | 
 | alternated | 
 | between | 
 | stormy | 
 | resentment | 
 | AND | 
 | cold | 
 | self | 
 | reproach | 
 | there | 
 | were | 
 | moments | 
 | TOO | 
 | OF | 
 | grey | 
 | ssensselepoh | 
 | AND | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | only | 
 | HER | 
 | constantly | 
 | recurring | 
 | noitangidni | 
 | that | 
 | swept | 
 | HER | 
 | OUT | 
 | OF | 
 | these | 
 | every | 
 | inch | 
 | OF | 
 | THE | 
 | roads | 
 | SHE | 
 | traversed | 
 | WAS | 
 | associated | 
 | with | 
 | HIM | 
 | every | 
 | gate | 
 | AND | 
 | tree | 
 | seemed | 
 | TO | 
 | call | 
 | OUT | 
 | IN | 
 | mocking | 
 | melancholy | 
 | this | 
 | WAS | 
 | where | 
 | this | 
 | WAS | 
 | where | 
 | NOT | 
 | A | 
 | street | 
 | corner | 
 | BUT | 
 | WAS | 
 | ylbacirtxeni | 
 | bound | 
 | UP | 
 | IN | 
 | HER | 
 | mind | 
 | with | 
 | some | 
 | remark | 
 | OF | 
 | HIS | 
 | AND | 
 | THE | 
 | exact | 
 | phase | 
 | OF | 
 | their | 
 | pihsnoitaler | 
 | when | 
 | HE | 
 | HAD | 
 | uttered | 
 | IT | 
 | under | 
 | heavy | 
 | trees | 
 | that | 
 | split | 
 | THE | 
 | moonlight | 
 | into | 
 | A | 
 | thousand | 
 | fragments | 
 | SHE | 
 | suddenly | 
 | heard | 
 | THE | 
 | rich | 
 | HUM | 
 | OF | 
 | A | 
 | grand | 
 | piano | 
 | SHE | 
 | stopped | 
 | SHE | 
 | stood | 
 | IN | 
 | THE | 
 | shadow | 
 | OF | 
 | THE | 
 | hedge | 
 | AND | 
 | listened | 
 | IN | 
 | rapture | 
 | THE | 
 | house | 
 | WAS | 
 | A | 
 | large | 
 | ONE | 
 | with | 
 | A | 
 | corner | 
 | BAY | 
 | window | 
 | wide | 
 | open | 
 | AND | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | from | 
 | that | 
 | room | 
 | evidently | 
 | that | 
 | THE | 
 | music | 
 | WAS | 
 | proceeding | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | some | 
 | rapid | 
 | piece | 
 | full | 
 | OF | 
 | rippling | 
 | streams | 
 | OF | 
 | notes | 
 | with | 
 | very | 
 | FEW | 
 | chords | 
 | octaves | 
 | IN | 
 | THE | 
 | base | 
 | clef | 
 | that | 
 | thundered | 
 | like | 
 | THE | 
 | oncoming | 
 | tide | 
 | swirling | 
 | waves | 
 | OF | 
 | treble | 
 | triplets | 
 | that | 
 | were | 
 | light | 
 | AS | 
 | AIR | 
 | YET | 
 | beneath | 
 | ALL | 
 | THE | 
 | laughter | 
 | AND | 
 | freedom | 
 | A | 
 | sense | 
 | OF | 
 | DIM | 
 | unuttered | 
 | passion | 
 | half | 
 | hopeful | 
 | half | 
 | melancholy | 
 | long | 
 | afterwards | 
 | SHE | 
 | knew | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | chopin’s | 
 | black | 
 | note | 
 | study | 
 | IN | 
 | G | 
 | flat | 
 | BUT | 
 | then | 
 | IT | 
 | HAD | 
 | NO | 
 | name | 
 | TO | 
 | HER | 
 | IT | 
 | might | 
 | have | 
 | been | 
 | THE | 
 | latest | 
 | ragtime | 
 | craze | 
 | FOR | 
 | ALL | 
 | SHE | 
 | knew | 
 | ALL | 
 | SHE | 
 | cared | 
 | WAS | 
 | that | 
 | IT | 
 | expressed | 
 | ALL | 
 | THE | 
 | feelings | 
 | IN | 
 | HER | 
 | OWN | 
 | heart | 
 | that | 
 | SHE | 
 | HAD | 
 | thought | 
 | elbisserpxeni | 
 | things | 
 | that | 
 | SHE | 
 | HAD | 
 | often | 
 | AND | 
 | IN | 
 | vain | 
 | tried | 
 | TO | 
 | wring | 
 | OUT | 
 | OF | 
 | THE | 
 | collard | 
 | AND | 
 | collard | 
 | AT | 
 | home | 
 | AT | 
 | that | 
 | moment | 
 | IT | 
 | IS | 
 | probable | 
 | that | 
 | SHE | 
 | would | 
 | have | 
 | given | 
 | everything | 
 | SHE | 
 | HAD | 
 | IN | 
 | THE | 
 | world | 
 | FOR | 
 | that | 
 | piano | 
 | IT | 
 | stood | 
 | TO | 
 | HER | 
 | AS | 
 | THE | 
 | ONE | 
 | WAY | 
 | TO | 
 | salvation | 
 | SHE | 
 | would | 
 | have | 
 | bartered | 
 | HER | 
 | soul | 
 | FOR | 
 | IT | 
 | AS | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | SHE | 
 | stood | 
 | there | 
 | IN | 
 | THE | 
 | spattered | 
 | moonlight | 
 | AND | 
 | cried | 
 | FOR | 
 | IT | 
 | AT | 
 | ANY | 
 | rate | 
 | SHE | 
 | cried | 
 | THE | 
 | piece | 
 | finished | 
 | UP | 
 | IN | 
 | A | 
 | tremendous | 
 | cascade | 
 | OF | 
 | double | 
 | octaves | 
 | AND | 
 | SHE | 
 | waited | 
 | nearly | 
 | half | 
 | AN | 
 | hour | 
 | after | 
 | that | 
 | hoping | 
 | THE | 
 | playing | 
 | might | 
 | begin | 
 | again | 
 | then | 
 | SHE | 
 | walked | 
 | back | 
 | TO | 
 | kitchener | 
 | road | 
 | almost | 
 | IN | 
 | A | 
 | state | 
 | OF | 
 | trance | 
 | THE | 
 | bockley | 
 | high | 
 | street | 
 | WAS | 
 | very | 
 | white | 
 | AND | 
 | deserted | 
 | AND | 
 | FAR | 
 | into | 
 | THE | 
 | DIM | 
 | distance | 
 | stretched | 
 | THE | 
 | tram | 
 | rails | 
 | blue | 
 | AND | 
 | infinite | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | long | 
 | past | 
 | eleven | 
 | BUT | 
 | catherine | 
 | WAS | 
 | dreaming | 
 | dreaming | 
 | OF | 
 | ONE | 
 | thing | 
 | only | 
 | though | 
 | that | 
 | ONE | 
 | thing | 
 | WAS | 
 | strangely | 
 | detacilpmoc | 
 | BY |

 | repeating | 
 | THE |

 | little | 
 | ashamed | 
 | OF | 
 | crying | 
 | I | 
 | never |

 | SHE | 
 | tried | 
 | TO | 
 | calm | 
 | herself | 
 | I’M | 
 | getting |

 | ALL | 
 | because |

 | that’s |

 | that’s | 
 | A | 
 | pity | 
 | SHE |

 | IN | 
 | HER | 
 | voice | 
 | something | 
 | happened | 
 | TO |

 | HER | 
 | ultimatum | 
 | because | 
 | i’ve | 
 | decided | 
 | TO | 
 | TO |

 | FOR | 
 | HIS |

 | HIM | 
 | catherine |

 | almost | 
 | hypnotized | 
 | BY | 
 | HIS | 
 | quick | 
 | startling | 
 | movements | 
 | SO | 
 | unlike | 
 | HIS | 
 | usual | 
 | apathy | 
 | HE | 
 | strode | 
 | firmly | 
 | down | 
 | THE |

 | AND | 
 | shut | 
 | THE | 
 | door | 
 | after | 
 | HIM | 
 | more |

 | SHE | 
 | could | 
 | hear | 
 | HIS |

 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | thrilled | 
 | BY | 
 | A | 
 | strange | 
 | feeling | 
 | OF | 
 | noitaralihxe | 
 | IT | 
 | seemed | 
 | TO | 
 | HER | 
 | that | 
 | after | 
 | AN | 
 | interval | 
 | OF | 
 | drudgery | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | once | 
 | again | 
 | being | 
 | drawn | 
 | into | 
 | THE | 
 | vortex | 
 | OF | 
 | momentous | 
 | happenings | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | absolutely | 
 | certain | 
 | OF | 
 | ONE |

 | SHE |

 | NOT |

 | HER | 
 | ecneidebosid | 
 | A | 
 | test |

 | HAD | 
 | paralysis | 
 | down | 
 | ONE | 
 | side | 
 | AND | 
 | existed | 
 | apparently | 
 | FOR | 
 | THE |

 | OF | 
 | proving | 
 | TO | 
 | ALL | 
 | other | 
 | girls | 
 | HOW | 
 | lucky |

 | about | 
 | waiting | 
 | FOR | 
 | THE |

 | along | 
 | AND | 
 | this | 
 | passive | 
 | method |

 | roused | 
 | ALL | 
 | THE | 
 | scorn | 
 | AND | 
 | contempt | 
 | IN |

 | about | 
 | HER | 
 | strumming | 
 | IN | 
 | A | 
 | third | 
 | rate | 
 | picture | 
 | house | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | typical | 
 | OF | 
 | HIM | 
 | TO | 
 | assume | 
 | that | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | third | 
 | rate | 
 | before | 
 | HE |

 | where | 
 | HE | 
 | marked | 
 | HIS |

 | then | 
 | probably | 
 | YOU |

 | give |

 | TO | 
 | HIM | 
 | TO |

 | SHE | 
 | replied | 
 | yletanoissap |

 | TO | 
 | HIM | 
 | BUT | 
 | continued |

 | HER | 
 | which | 
 | always | 
 | told | 
 | THE | 
 | truth | 
 | YOU | 
 | _will_ | 
 | give | 
 | IN | 
 | TO | 
 | HIM | 
 | IF |

 | SHE | 
 | wrote | 
 | THE | 
 | letter | 
 | AS | 
 | quickly | 
 | AS | 
 | SHE | 
 | could | 
 | FOR | 
 | THE | 
 | feeling | 
 | OF | 
 | supreme | 
 | depression | 
 | THE | 
 | feeling | 
 | that | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | doing | 
 | something | 
 | elbatterger | 
 | AND | 
 | ylbaveirterri |

 | every | 
 | second | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | just | 
 | addressing | 
 | THE | 
 | envelope | 
 | after | 
 | fastening | 
 | IT | 
 | when | 
 | SHE | 
 | heard | 
 | THE | 
 | KEY | 
 | fumbling | 
 | AT | 
 | THE | 
 | front | 
 | door | 
 | FOR | 
 | THE | 
 | moment | 
 | A | 
 | kind | 
 | OF | 
 | panic | 
 | fear | 
 | seized | 
 | HER | 
 | HE | 
 | WAS | 
 | coming | 
 | back | 
 | HE | 
 | must | 
 | have | 
 | turned | 
 | back | 
 | before | 
 | reaching | 
 | THE | 
 | school | 
 | HIS | 
 | footsteps | 
 | down | 
 | THE | 
 | lobby | 
 | sounded | 
 | brutal | 
 | AND | 
 | ylirassecennu | 
 | noisy | 
 | SHE | 
 | swung | 
 | round | 
 | IN | 
 | HER | 
 | chair | 
 | AND | 
 | SAT | 
 | awaiting | 
 | HIS | 
 | entrance | 
 | with | 
 | THE | 
 | penholder | 
 | stuck | 
 | between | 
 | HER |

 | THE |

 | LAY | 
 | ON | 
 | THE |

 | HE | 
 | flung | 
 | down | 
 | HIS | 
 | HAT | 
 | AND | 
 | coat | 
 | ON | 
 | THE | 
 | table | 
 | THE | 
 | moment | 
 | WAS | 
 | SO | 
 | tense | 
 | that | 
 | catherine | 
 | spoke | 
 | merely | 
 | TO | 
 | interrupt | 
 | THE | 
 | horrible | 
 | silence | 
 | OF | 
 | IT | 
 | WAS | 
 | there | 
 | NO | 
 | school | 
 | TO | 
 | night | 
 | SHE | 
 | asked | 
 | with | 
 | AN | 
 | effort | 
 | TO | 
 | appear | 
 | perfectly | 
 | casual | 
 | I’M | 
 | NOT | 
 | going | 
 | HE | 
 | snapped | 
 | curtly | 
 | AND | 
 | took | 
 | down | 
 | THE | 
 | RED | 
 | INK | 
 | bottle | 
 | from | 
 | THE | 
 | corner | 
 | OF | 
 | THE |

 | HE | 
 | WAS | 
 | going | 
 | TO | 
 | spend | 
 | THE | 
 | evening | 
 | marking | 
 | exercise | 
 | books | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | thoroughly | 
 | frightened | 
 | HER | 
 | mother’s | 
 | tempers | 
 | AND | 
 | tirades | 
 | HAD | 
 | never | 
 | frightened | 
 | HER | 
 | because | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | used | 
 | TO | 
 | them | 
 | AND | 
 | knew | 
 | them | 
 | intimately | 
 | AS | 
 | A | 
 | doctor | 
 | knows | 
 | THE | 
 | illness | 
 | OF | 
 | A | 
 | familiar | 
 | patient | 
 | BUT | 
 | HER | 
 | father | 
 | WAS | 
 | normally |

 | quiet | 
 | AND | 
 | placid | 
 | AND | 
 | mild | 
 | mannered | 
 | SHE | 
 | HAD | 
 | never | 
 | seen | 
 | HIM | 
 | IN | 
 | A | 
 | temper | 
 | although | 
 | when | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | A | 
 | little | 
 | girl | 
 | boys | 
 | WHO | 
 | were | 
 | IN | 
 | HIS | 
 | class | 
 | AT |

 | HAD | 
 | told | 
 | HER | 
 | that | 
 | ON | 
 | rare | 
 | occasions | 
 | HE | 
 | GOT | 
 | ratty | 
 | BUT | 
 | SHE | 
 | HAD | 
 | never | 
 | known | 
 | HIM | 
 | IN | 
 | such | 
 | A | 
 | condition | 
 | IN | 
 | this | 
 | phase | 
 | HE | 
 | WAS | 
 | A | 
 | complete | 
 | stranger | 
 | TO | 
 | HER | 
 | AND | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS | 
 | evisneherppa | 
 | AS | 
 | SHE | 
 | would | 
 | have | 
 | been | 
 | IF | 
 | A | 
 | stranger | 
 | HAD | 
 | entered | 
 | THE |

 | when | 
 | SHE | 
 | WAS |

 | HE | 
 | came | 
 | TO | 
 | THE | 
 | desk | 
 | TO | 
 | GET | 
 | HIS | 
 | exercise | 
 | books | 
 | SHE | 
 | thought | 
 | AT | 
 | first | 
 | HE | 
 | WAS | 
 | going | 
 | TO | 
 | strike | 
 | HER | 
 | BUT | 
 | HE | 
 | merely | 
 | leaned |

 | politeness | 
 | HIS | 
 | unusual |
